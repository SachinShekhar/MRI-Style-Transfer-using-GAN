# MRI Style Transfer using GAN

To build a Generative Adversarial Network model to generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels ([T1-weighted vs T2-weighted Images](https://case.edu/med/neurology/NR/MRI%20Basics.htm)) from existing MRI scans.

It can save MRI scan time while still enabling expert radiologists to properly give opinions using both T1-weighted as well as T2-weighted images.
